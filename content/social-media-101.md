main_content = "## Details\n\nI am Aimee Ravichandran, the CEO of Abundantly Social. I grew up in San Antonio, Texas where I attended UTSA and graduated with a Bachelor in Psychology. During that time, I began working with Houston-known Sandy Lawrence, CEO of Perceptive Public Relations. That’s where I began to learn the ins and outs of social media and develop a great understanding of managing different type of business' social media accounts. However, I did not stop there! I went on to take courses and attended numerous Social Media Examiner webinars, learning about social media marketing and consulting. That was about 6 years ago. I started Abundantly Social, doing what I love, helping businesses breakthrough on the social media market and getting them out there to the world.\n\nIn Social Media 101 I am teaching you the basics of Social Media Marketing and how to apply them to your business, as well as answer any of your questions about Social Media Marketing. In addition, I will show you how to create a basic and successful Facebook Ad for your business."
