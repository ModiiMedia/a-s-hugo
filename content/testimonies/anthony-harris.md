testimony_text: "Aimee Ravichandran is the consummate professional, who delivers superior products and services, in a timely and efficient manner. In addition, she is an extraordinarily talented and creative woman, who keeps her word and delivers what she promises. As a book author, I depend on Aimee to manage my social media and my website, which she designed and built. As a result, there has been consistently high traffic on my website and on my author's Facebook page. In addition to that, what I appreciate most about Aimee is her accessibility and the immediacy of her replies to queries and comments."
