testimony_text: "Aimee went above and beyond all my expectations. She took the time to get to know me and who I am first before she started learning about my business. She gave me several questions to answer and then based on my feedback she created 2 beautiful websites in less than one week's time. Aimee has a talent for bringing other people's ideas and creations to life on social media while also weaving in their true personality. She really cares about her clients and it shows in her work. She's creative, hardworking, trustworthy and she gets projects done quickly. I really can't say enough great things about her and would recommend her to everyone."
