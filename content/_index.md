  testimony_text: Aimee Ravichandran is the consummate professional, who delivers
    superior products and services, in a timely and efficient manner. In addition,
    she is an extraordinarily talented and creative woman, who keeps her word and
    delivers what she promises. As a book author, I depend on Aimee to manage my social
    media and my website, which she designed and built. As a result, there has been
    consistently high traffic on my website and on my author's Facebook page. In addition
    to that, what I appreciate most about Aimee is her accessibility and the immediacy
    of her replies to queries and comments.

  testimony_text: Aimee went above and beyond all my expectations. She took the time
    to get to know me and who I am first before she started learning about my business.
    She gave me several questions to answer and then based on my feedback she created
    2 beautiful websites in less than one week's time. Aimee has a talent for bringing
    other people's ideas and creations to life on social media while also weaving
    in their true personality. She really cares about her clients and it shows in
    her work. She's creative, hardworking, trustworthy and she gets projects done
    quickly. I really can't say enough great things about her and would recommend
    her to everyone.
