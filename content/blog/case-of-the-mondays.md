Ever wake up on a Monday and just been in a mood? That was me this morning. I start my morning routine of making some hot tea and starting work, when the dogs (Thor and Hercules) started jumping on and off the couch trying to get my attention. They wanted to make it clear that they needed to go outside. I tried to put it off as long as I could to finish my meetings and work for the day, which was not going to happen. I shut my laptop frustrated that the dogs could not wait a couple more minutes. Moments like this I wish we had a yard that I could just let the dogs out the backdoor and continue what I was doing. I put the harnesses on the dogs and we begin our daily walk around the lake. 

## Still frustrated I was trying to get the walk over as fast as I could. 

To give you a run down on how the walk usually goes I can sum it up in ONE sentence "Thor and Hercules MUST SMELL EVERYTHING". Today I was just not in the mood to sit outside for an hour while they smell every inch of grass that is within the apartment complex grounds. So I am hurrying this walk and not letting them stop to smell everything in the world. When Thor began to fight me he wanted to smell these flowers.

## That's when it HIT ME! 

I needed to enjoy this moment and not be in such a hurry to get it over with. I needed to stop and smell the flowers as Thor so thoughtfully showed me. It is sad that it took my dog to show me what I should be doing during our walk. I should use our walks to unplug and take a break from work. Lesson learn for the day from my amazing dogs!

After our walk today I was in my usual happy mood again and enjoying the day. Always stop and smell the flowers like Thor, make it a point to get outside and enjoy the day and take a break from working. This is how we are ending our day with this amazing view, perfect ending to what turned out to be a great day!
