What do you do when someone you love is struggling with making their dream a reality?

I am a very positive and compassionate person when someone else is hurting emotionally I hurt with them.  Well my husband whom I usually make fun of on these blog post is that person this time. Now I love my husband more than anything and to see him struggle but still be motivated to do whatever he can to get a Chemical Engineering job is inspiring, but at the same time it makes me hurt for him.

Now I always claim that my husband does not have emotions except when it comes to me. So he does not show how discouraged he is  losing hope in the sole reason we moved to Houston. To watch someone I love lose hope in something they are so passionate about is incredibly hard.

In this photo I am singing that song "Don't Stop Believin" by Journey to him at our wedding. Those words could not be more true now. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/modii/w_840,q_50,f_auto/v1536621957/abundantlysocial/blog%20post.jpg)

The fact that he keeps pushing through and trying to make his dream happen also makes me so incredibly proud of him! He is so inspiring and I wanted to share his struggle because I know that it is also someone else's struggle. Turn that into your motivation and make it happen. YOU can make anything happen just have to put that work in.

Happy Motivational Monday Y'all.
